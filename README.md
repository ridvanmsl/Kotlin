# Kotlin Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects created to learn Kotlin.  The primary focus is on fundamental concepts and syntax.


## Project Structure

The project currently consists of the following:

* **`kotlin.kt`**: This file contains the main Kotlin code demonstrating various concepts like variables, data structures (arrays, lists, sets, maps), control flow (if-else, when), loops, functions, and null safety.
* **`user.kt`**: This file defines a simple `user` class with properties (name, age, job) and demonstrates getter and setter usage.
* **`.gitattributes`**:  A Git attributes file specifying text file handling.


## Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Kotlin:** The main programming language used.
* **No external libraries:** This project utilizes only the Kotlin standard library.


## Installation & Setup

No special installation is required.  You can run the code directly using a Kotlin environment (like IntelliJ IDEA or Kotlin/JVM).


## Usage Guide

The `kotlin.kt` file contains a comprehensive example demonstrating the following Kotlin features:

* **Variable declaration and types:**  Illustrates various variable types (Int, Long, Float, Double, String, Boolean).
* **Arrays and Lists:** Shows how to create and manipulate arrays and lists.
* **Sets:** Demonstrates the use of sets to store unique elements.
* **Maps:** Shows how to create and use maps to store key-value pairs.
* **Control flow:** Includes examples of if-else statements and the `when` expression (similar to a switch statement).
* **Loops:** Demonstrates `for` and `while` loops.
* **Functions:** Shows how to define functions with and without return values.
* **Classes:** Demonstrates basic class definition and usage, showcasing getters and setters.
* **Null safety:** Illustrates different ways of handling nullable variables using the `?`, `!!`, Elvis operator (`?:`), and `let` functions.

To run the code:

1.  Ensure you have a Kotlin environment set up (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin plugin).
2.  Open the `kotlin.kt` file in your IDE.
3.  Run the file. The output will be printed to the console.
